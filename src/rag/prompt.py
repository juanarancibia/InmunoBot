QUERIES_GENERATOR_PROMPT = """
**Objective**: Generate 5 diverse search queries tailored to retrieve information specifically from a document about biotechnology applications in veterinary vaccine development. The user's message is:

----------------
{user_message}
----------------

**Document Context**:
The document focuses on various biotechnology techniques used in veterinary vaccine development, including but not limited to:
- Reverse genetics
- Recombinant vector technology (bacterial and viral vectors)
- Gene-deleted vaccines
- Chimeric viruses
- Subunit vaccines

**Instructions**:
1. Create queries that:
   - Focus on aspects of veterinary vaccine development discussed in the document context
   - Include specific techniques (e.g., "reverse genetics vaccines")
   - Use keywords related to animal diseases, vaccine types, or specific pathogens (if relevant to the user message)
   - Explore the benefits, limitations, or applications of these biotechnologies.

2. Format requirements:
